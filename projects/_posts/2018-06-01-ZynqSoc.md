This project follows Andrew Powell's work, implementing high level synthesis
real-time audio processing with the FIR filter based on Zynq-SoC Embedded system.
At the beginning, we are supposed to establish the ARM-Linux Embedded system on
Zynq board, which needs a lot of tedious work and provides the essential platform for
the following software development. In that process, we get over lots of difficulties,
such as the non-commonality between different version of Vivado, the disconnection
of serial port, the utilization of pre-production modules ... And finally we clear a
path through. The next challenging task we accomplish is to drive the hardware
modules, including SSIM2603 audio codec and ADI I2S core, a protocol for audio
transmission. Last but not least, we develop the audio processing software under
the instruction of Andrew Powell's github and demonstrate the availability of its
running on the Embedded system established before.
