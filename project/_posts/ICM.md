We are asked to explore the develop strategies of Tesla charging stations for various countries under the situation of gradual migration from gas to electric vehicles. In just four days, we addressed five tasks related to optimization and sensitivity analysis, taking such a wide variety of factors as different geographies, population density and wealth distributions into account, and fully elaborate the proposed develop scheme in final paper. More details are shown in [Githup repo](https://github.com/ranery/2018-ICM-D)
